# gateControl
I want to create an API which we can control the gate from device

## To check the status of gate
http://localhost/newquotation/readStatus.php

0 - gate is closed
1 - gate is opened

## Raspabery pi command to close the gate

http://localhost/newquotation/closeGate.php

## Raspabery pi command to open the gate

http://localhost/newquotation/openGate.php

## A test interface where we can manually open and close the gate
http://localhost/newquotation/controlGate.php
